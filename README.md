# Forest Cover Web Mapping Application

This interactive web mapping application visualizes the percentage of forest cover across U.S. states using a choropleth map built with Leaflet.js. The objective of the project is to help users explore spatial patterns in forest distribution, compare forest cover between states, and better understand broad land-use trends across the United States. The map integrates several interactive features including hover-based data display, clickable state boundaries, multiple basemap options, a legend, a scale bar, and a search tool that allows users to locate states directly from the GeoJSON data. A time slider can also be incorporated to visualize forest cover change across multiple years.

The forest cover dataset used in this application was derived from publicly available U.S. government open data. Colors and breakpoints were created using chroma.js to ensure a clear and intuitive classification of forest percentage values. The project’s design and functionality were inspired in part by the article *“POLLINATION ECOLOGY IN THE 21ST CENTURY: KEY QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH”* by Carolin Mayer et al. (2011), which emphasizes the importance of clear, accessible ecological data visualization for both scientific and public audiences.

This application was authored by **Devin Axtell** as part of coursework involving geospatial data visualization and thematic cartography.
